These are not promises :)

prio steps
- create story: add participants, set word limit, set timeout?
  - contribution must be within word limit
  - word counter for text field: error when in excess
- decent markup (web)
- more markup options for contributing (and how to store that? WYSIWYG?
- menu system for /story and /dashboard urls?
- example on frontpage (finished story)
- api

ideas
- more js, less twig (react?) / realtime refresh?
- timeout for idleness (turns to next person) (after x amount of idle rounds or timeouts, the story ends)
- more tests
- inline story contributing (like a word document?)
- upload pictures for contribution

small steps:
- menu system for /story and /dashboard urls?
- validate contributions
- google analytics
- register/confirmed redirects to dashboard
- welcome message to new users
- private games
- reverse turn order (from high to lowest
- don't allow spam of new story creations/contributions
- contribute: make sure participant is authenticated and authorized (is it his turn?)
- block IP (range)
- notifications, set by screen, mail
  - note when story is contributed, your turn, or invited, timeout warning, timed out
- invite system
  - invites: participant is not activated until accepted invite

- show case best stories on frontpage


intermediate steps:
- API all crud actions of entities
- rating system for stories and/or participants
- admin panel
- moderation per game

big steps:
- app
    - push notifications
